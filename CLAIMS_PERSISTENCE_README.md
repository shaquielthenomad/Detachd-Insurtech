# Claims Persistence System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation fixes the claims persistence issue in the Detachd Insurance Platform. Previously, claims were not being properly stored and were not showing up in the dashboard. Now, claims are properly persisted to localStorage and correctly displayed across all views.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Claims Storage Service** (`services/claimsStorage.ts`)
- Created a centralized service for managing claims in localStorage
- Handles storage, retrieval, updates, and statistics
- Provides consistent interface for both user and admin views
- Supports audit trails and claim state management

### 2. **Declaration Page Updates** (`components/claims/DeclarationPage.tsx`)
- Updated to use the new `ClaimsStorageService`
- Properly stores claims with all necessary metadata
- Includes risk scoring, audit trails, and user association

### 3. **My Claims Page Updates** (`components/claims/MyClaimsPage.tsx`)
- Replaced hardcoded mock data with real localStorage data
- Shows actual submitted claims for both policyholders and insurers
- Properly filters claims by user role and ownership

### 4. **Dashboard Integration** (`components/dashboard/DashboardOverviewPage.tsx`)
- Updated to use real claims statistics from storage
- Dynamic charts and metrics based on actual claim data
- Real-time updates when claims are submitted

## Key Features

### Storage Structure
```javascript
// Main claims list
localStorage['detachd_claims'] = [claim1, claim2, ...]

// Individual claims
localStorage['claim_${claimId}'] = claimData

// User-specific claims
localStorage['user_claims_${userId}'] = [userClaim1, userClaim2, ...]
```

### Claim Data Structure
```typescript
interface StoredClaim {
  id: string;
  claimNumber: string;
  policyholderName: string;
  dateOfLoss: string;
  claimType: string;
  status: ClaimStatus;
  amountClaimed: number;
  location: string;
  description: string;
  policyNumber?: string;
  submittedAt: string;
  riskScore: number;
  fraudAlerts: any[];
  documentFlags: any[];
  verificationData?: any;
  isInsuranceClaim: boolean;
  assignedTo?: string;
  priority?: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  lastActivity?: string;
  auditTrail?: Array<{
    timestamp: string;
    event: string;
    user: string;
  }>;
  certificateIssued?: boolean;
}
```

## How to Test

### 1. **Using the Demo Claims Setup**
Load `demo-claims-setup.js` in the browser console and run:
```javascript
demoClaimsSetup();
```
This will populate localStorage with sample claims for testing.

### 2. **Submit a New Claim**
1. Navigate to "New Claim" from the dashboard
2. Fill out the claim form through all steps
3. Submit the claim on the Declaration page
4. Verify it appears in "My Claims" and dashboard statistics

### 3. **Test Different User Roles**
- **Policyholder**: See only their own claims
- **Insurer Admin**: See all claims across the system
- **Super Admin**: See system-wide statistics and all claims

### 4. **Verify Persistence**
1. Submit claims
2. Refresh the page
3. Navigate between different pages
4. Claims should persist across sessions

## API Endpoints Affected

The following components now use the localStorage-based system instead of relying solely on API calls:

- `MyClaimsPage` - Displays user and admin claims
- `DashboardOverviewPage` - Shows real statistics
- `DeclarationPage` - Stores submitted claims
- `ClaimDetailsPage` - Retrieves individual claim data

## Data Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Submits Claim] --> B[DeclarationPage]
    B --> C[ClaimsStorageService.storeClaim]
    C --> D[localStorage Storage]
    D --> E[Multiple Storage Keys]
    E --> F[detachd_claims]
    E --> G[claim_${id}]
    E --> H[user_claims_${userId}]
    
    I[Dashboard/Claims Views] --> J[ClaimsStorageService.getAllClaims]
    J --> D
    J --> K[Display Real Data]
```

## Storage Methods

### Core Methods
- `ClaimsStorageService.storeClaim()` - Store new claim
- `ClaimsStorageService.getAllClaims()` - Get all claims
- `ClaimsStorageService.getUserClaims(userId)` - Get user-specific claims
- `ClaimsStorageService.getClaim(claimId)` - Get specific claim
- `ClaimsStorageService.updateClaim(claimId, updates)` - Update claim
- `ClaimsStorageService.getClaimsStats()` - Get statistics

### Utility Methods
- `ClaimsStorageService.addAuditEntry()` - Add audit trail entry
- `ClaimsStorageService.getInsurerViewClaims()` - Get claims for admin view
- `ClaimsStorageService.clearAllClaims()` - Clear all data (for testing)

## Benefits

### 1. **Real Data Display**
- Claims actually show up after submission
- Dashboard reflects real claim statistics
- No more empty or hardcoded lists

### 2. **Role-Based Views**
- Policyholders see only their claims
- Insurers see all claims system-wide
- Proper data isolation and security

### 3. **Persistence Across Sessions**
- Claims survive page refreshes
- Data persists between browser sessions
- Consistent experience across the app

### 4. **Audit Trail Support**
- Complete history of claim actions
- User attribution for all events
- Timestamp tracking for compliance

## Future Enhancements

1. **API Integration**: Replace localStorage with proper backend API
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live claim updates
3. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated search and filter options
4. **Export Features**: CSV/PDF export of claims data
5. **Analytics**: Advanced reporting and insights

## Troubleshooting

### Claims Not Showing
1. Check browser localStorage in DevTools
2. Look for `detachd_claims` key
3. Run `demoClaimsSetup()` to populate test data

### Data Corruption
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Refresh the page
3. Re-populate with demo data or submit new claims

### Role Issues
1. Verify user role in localStorage (`authToken` or `userRole`)
2. Ensure proper user authentication
3. Check role-based filtering in claims service

## File Changes Summary

### New Files
- `services/claimsStorage.ts` - Claims storage service
- `demo-claims-setup.js` - Demo data setup script
- `CLAIMS_PERSISTENCE_README.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `components/claims/DeclarationPage.tsx` - Updated to use storage service
- `components/claims/MyClaimsPage.tsx` - Replaced mock data with real data
- `components/dashboard/DashboardOverviewPage.tsx` - Added real statistics

### Integration Points
- All dashboard components now use real claim data
- Claims submission properly stores to localStorage
- User and admin views correctly filtered by role
- Statistics and metrics reflect actual claim data

âœ… **The claims persistence issue has been fully resolved!** Claims are now properly stored when submitted and correctly displayed in both the policyholder "My Claims" view and the insurer admin claims view.
